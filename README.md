### What I learned

One thing that I learned that I didn't know before was the math behind nested border-radii. While in SWE Bootcamp, I was looking for some magical property to do it but it comes down to hard math as shown here -
[Random Cloud Four Article I found online](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/the-math-behind-nesting-rounded-corners/).

```--outer-radius: 1em;
--padding: 0.5em;
--inner-radius: calc(var(--outer-radius) - var(--padding));
```
